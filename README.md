# Fylo landing page?

## What is this project?

This project is made more to get in touch with my css skills, as well as learning a few new stuff. I've used a landing page layout from Frontend Mentor as a basis for this project.

## What I've used in this project

* Webpack (HMR, Stylelint, SASS, some stuff for the development environment) 
* Postcss (Autoprefixer)
* Handlebars (To dynamically render the HTML using a static json)

## Can I have a look at it?

Yeah sure, here it is https://flyo-landing-page.leroy.now.sh
